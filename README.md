# Smart Village

The Smart Village project improves rural life by addressing challenges
such as limited crop management info, education, healthcare, markets,
exploitation and lack of training. It provides an online marketplace,
digital education, healthcare, crop management tips, notices, and a
voting system. It promotes employment, entrepreneurship, economic
development, skill training and community engagement.
